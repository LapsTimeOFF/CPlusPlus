# Create the first program
You want to create your first C++ program ? Oh nice !<br>
So let's start !
## Create the file
I will explain that to you in few steps :<br>
    1. You need to create the file. In the **BIGGGGG** world of the development we name the main file with this name : `main.cpp`<br>
    2. Now, open the file with an IDE (Example : VSCode) and **NO** Notepad is not an IDE<br>
    3. Import the main library like that :<br>
    `#include <iostream>`<br>
    4. Like in every language of development will do the **FAMOUS** *Hello World !*<br>
    But now I need to go. Bye Bye (It's not a joke I really need to go when I write this page)
